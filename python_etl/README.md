# Python ETL with tests and SQLite target

This project demonstrates a compact ETL using pandas, configuration in YAML, logging, and tests with pytest.

Quick start
1. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies from requirements.txt.
2. Run `python app.py` to execute the pipeline.
3. Run `pytest -q` to execute tests.
4. Inspect `data/warehouse.sqlite` to see loaded tables.
